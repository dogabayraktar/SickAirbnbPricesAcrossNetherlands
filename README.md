# "How Covid-19 infected the Airbnb market in The Netherlands"
# A study on how the second lockdown in the Netherlands affected the AirBnb market in Amsterdam


Research question: To what extend did the number of hosts, the location of the Airbnbs and the prices of the Airbnbs in Amsterdam change during and after the second lockdown compared to before the second lockdown?

## Motivation
At the end of 2019, the first infection of the corona virus was detected in China and since then this virus has gripped almost all countries in the world (Chen et al., 2020).The Netherlands has also been affected by the corona virus and has had to take various measures to limit the spread of the corona virus. In December 2020, the Netherlands entered the second lockdown. = During this lockdown, the Netherlands had to deal with far-reaching measures.  Some examples of these gripping measures are:

* Keep 1.5 meters away from people who are not part of your household;
* All non-essential visiting locations were closed;
* Only use public transport if necessary.

The above examples are just a few examples of the measures which were applied during the second lockdown and it is almost inconceivable that these measures have not had an impact on the AirBnb market. Therefore, this study will pay attention to the concequences of this second lockdown on the Airbnb market. Because it is expected that Covid-19 affects different aspects within the AirBnb market, different variables will be taken into account namely: the prices of AirBnbs in Amsterdam, The number of hosts in Amsterdam and the locations of the AirBnbs in Amsterdam. 

Ultimately, this study will therefore answer the following questions:
* How did the prices of the Airbnbs, the location of the airbnbs and the number of host change during the second lockdown compared with the before the second lockdown?
* How did the prices of the Airbnbs, the location of the airbnbs and the number of host change after the second lockdown compared with during the second lockdown?
* How did the prices of the Airbnbs, the location of the airbnbs and the number of host change after the second lockdown compared with before the second lockdown?

With the information obtained from this study, AirBnb owners can more easily respond to the wishes of customers during the next pandemic or lockdown and thereby limit their economic damage from that pandemic/epidemic. Covid-19 is not the first pandemic/epidemic that the earth has known and research expects that it will not be the last (WHO, 2020). 
This study therefore helps AirBnb owners to prepare for the next pandemic/epidemic.

## Research method

## Way of deployment


## Data
For this project, two data sets will be used. Inside Airbnb set contains the Airbnb listings within the Amsterdam, The Netherlands area. This data set will be used to extract information to see the price changes. The second data set namely;COVID-19 Casus Landelijk contains information regarding the COVID-19 cases and their numbers across the Netherlands. We will be only convering the Noord-Holland area from this dataset to match our Airbnb listing locations.
